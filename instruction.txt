Instruction on how to run the program:

1- go to the source code directory : $cd ir
2- compile the java files: $ javac *.java
3- run the main program: $java Main

you have 3 options: 1- enter inputs from console/terminal
					2- provide an input file name, which needs to be in same directory as other java files
					3- exit

option 1: 
	in this option, user will be asked to enter size of the board then the data for each field. 
	valid input for size are positive integer (0-100).
	valid entry for field status are either . or *
	. means a safe field and * means mined field. other characters will be interpreted as . or safe field.
	after program finishes reading the data as much as the board size, then it prints out the revealed board
	with the mined fields shown in * and their adjacent fields with a number. 
	number means the amount of the mined fields next to that safe field.

option 2:
	if user selects this option, program asks for a input data file, which needs to be in the same directory as the other java files.
	it then reads the file contents and prints out the result board. it also write the result board to a file in the same directory.

other notes: 
	* sample data files has been provided: mines.txt
	* in option 2, output file name is: result.txt
